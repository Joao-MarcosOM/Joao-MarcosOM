## About Me

ðŸŒ± I started my professional journey at the age of 16 in the food industry with JÃ³ia Mineira, where I began as a production collaborator. Through dedication and effort, I achieved continuous progress and reached the position of responsible for financial services, spending 4 years and 7 months in the role.

ðŸš€ Seeking a new direction in my career, I decided to pursue my true passion: technology. I left my previous position and started an internship at SolviTech, where I quickly evolved and currently lead a development team. I have been with SolviTech for 1 year and 3 months.

ðŸ“š I am constantly expanding my knowledge and skills. As an ongoing student at Rocketseat, a renowned tech education platform, I am honing my programming skills and staying up to date with the latest technologies and trends.
